although the vote sunday is expected to be largely free,
erdogan has used the levers of state to stack the field in his favor. 
in the run-up to the election, 
he tapped the treasury for populist spending programs that raised the minimum wage, 
lowered the retirement age and distributed free natural gas. 
the president and his allies also were afforded blanket media coverage 
one state outlet covered erdogan’s campaign for more than 32 straight hours while devoting just 32 minutes to kilicdaroglu, 
according to an estimate from turkey’s broadcast watchdog.
